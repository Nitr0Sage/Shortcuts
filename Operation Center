    <td>Space Station - Rewards with Tech</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The facility's harvest is underway. I can speed up systems by boosting some of the machinery operating below me. What appears to be a power management screen is open on the terminal.

    <td>The facility is processing a signal that emanates from a distant location deep in space. Endless processing units are combining to crack the code of a strange mathematical langauge. Rare elements are being pulled from the resource vaults at [Screenshot cuts the rest off]</td>

    <td>A biological probe antenna launches from the terminal and fuses with my exosuit. I can't move. There's no way to tell if this is a normal function, or a security measure.</td>
    <td>Escape - Reward unknown, but is the correct answer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The security alarm hasn't impacted production. Below my feet unseen equipment prepares the mineral harvest. I can speed up the process by eliminating unnecessary systems. The on-screen automated report will help...</td>
    <td>Remove gravitational stabilisers - Reward unkown, but is correct answer</td>

    <td>I open a list of military achievements that's waiting for upload. There are images of distant battles, bloodied robots and vast explosions. A covering note clearing expects somthing in return, but the author chose not to send it.</td>

    <td>A animated gilled blob is on-screen waving a gun. It talks in the language of the warriors, but brightly and happily. It springs happily between bloodied runes, and then asks for a donation of units.</td>

    <td>Military insignia and images of recently destroyed sentinals fill the screen. alien propaganda imagery takes glory in the destruction. I can respond with a numerical value, and nothing else.</td>

</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Interferance from the security alert has turned the screen to static. I can hardly make out anything beyond a few words. If I can work out which workflow has been scrambled I can restore systems.

A rare silicate would likely do the trick. Databank alpha bares the emblems of the warrior race, but beta and gamma are otherwise unmarked.</td>
