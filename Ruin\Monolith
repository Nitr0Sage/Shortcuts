    <td> I am trying to read the glyphs on the ancient monument when I feel a strange chill. A layer of frozen gas suddenly coats the monolith from bottom to top. It’s so cold that I can see my breath inside my helmet. There is one small gap in the crystal ice, and I feel convinced that I could feed some of my mined elements through it, so they can come into contact with the monolith behind.</td>
    <td>Insert isotope element (10 Carbon) – You’ll get an Atlas word, more reputation with the Vy’keen and a commodity item.</td>

    <td>I see a strange vision. A small terrified creature emerges from the monolith and runs between my legs. I hear the noises of an ancient hunt: the howls of pack animals in pursuit and the thunder of hooves. Warriors on vast beasts charge through the rock, and amidst the chaos one sees me staring. It raises its facial tendrils in greeting, barks a few words and swings a bladed weapon down towards me.</td>
    <td>Grab weapon – You’ll receive a new mutlitool and some Vy’keen reputation.</td>

  <tr>
    <td> The body of a warrior emerges from the obelisk, a jagged tear in their midriff suggesting that the dangerous-looking multi-tool that sits in their hand was not enough to save them. The surface of the sculpted rock blurs and shows images of military worship. It’s trying to tell me something.</td>
    <td>Take the multi-tool and leave – A new mutltitool (might be worse than the one you have) and decreased standing with the Vy’keen<br><br>Bury the soldier and multi-tool – You’ll get an Atlas word, increased Vy’keen reputation and a health refill.</td>

  <tr>
    <td> I place my palm on the monolith, then stand back when it melts in response to my touch. Molten rock drips down the stone, exposing a hollow interior. Inside, I see riches that are beyond belief. Ancient technologies and cargo that would aid my journey. Lava continues to drop, and the edifice seems unstable, but equipment that could aid me is within arm’s reach. Suddenly, the voice of an ancient tribe shakes the ground I stand on..</td>

My vision is clouding. I know it is my time. This is it. This is what it feels like. Suddenly, a green hand thrusts itself through the surface of the water. The light is fading.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Two ancient stone cups materialise in front of the monolith. One is filled with a dark red viscous liquid, the other contains a sticky fluid that is bright yellow and smells powerfully bitter. On the stone tablet behind the cup ancient glyphs form an image. A powerful muscular warrior surrounded by a red halo challenges an opponent clad in bright yellow armour.</td>

    <td>The monolith shows images of creatures lying dead before it. Each sacrificed, butchered and offered up to whatever Gods were once worshipped. Suddenly, the head of a small woodland animal raises up through the earth below me. It stares ar me with wide-eyes, then gives a joyful skip when its tiny hooves reach ground level. Something is clearly expected of me…</td>

    <td> I become a part of a strange new reality. The ancient rock opens. Inside, the dried out heart of an ancient warrior is strung up between wooden pillars. It pulses slowly as it hangs there, still beating. Lying below it on a dusty floor are a set of wrinkled lungs that look forever doomed to wheeze stale air. A desiccated eyeball stares up at me. Unblinking.</td>
    <td>Place lungs with heat – This one will increase your Vy’keen reputation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The Monolith rips like paper, opening a window to another world. It is laced with a giant web. Just within my reach, an ancient warrior lies cocooned. It has been there for centuries. Dead, vacant eyes stare through me and on into the landscape beyond. It carries a rusted multi-tool, while a bulging webbed sack on its chest suggest it might carry greater riches on its body. Suddenly, the strange leathery growth starts to move…</td>
    <td>Search Body – You’ll learn a new Atlas word, and get Vy’keen Effigy. <br><br>Take Multi-tool – You’ll learn a new blueprint and an Atlas Word.</td>

    <td> I live within a new reality. I am inside a vast coliseum and beneath a blood red sky. The noise is overpowering. Warriors scream and bark at the battle set up before them. Two combatants are squaring up on the crimson sand. One has lost its blade, and hides behind a shield. The other stalks towards it, with spear raised. I feel compelled to add my voice to the howl of the mob.</td>
    <td>Support spear-wielding gladiator – You’ll learn an Atlas word and get a new multi-tool. <br><br>Support endangered gladiator – You’ll learn an Atlas word and get a new exosuit blueprint.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I place my hand on the ancient structure and feel an intense heat burning within. Suddenly, as if attracted to my suit, a liquid metal starts to seep from a hole that’s been broken into the rock. What starts as a drip becomes a surge forcing itself through the gap. The monolit’s previous contents are draining, and its glow is starting to fade. A voice screams out.</td>
    <td>Plug hole with oxide (100 iron) – You’ll learn an Atlas word, get increased Vy’keen standing and Vy’keen Dagger. <br><br>Plug hole with silicate (100 Heridium) – You’ll get a decrease in Vy’keen standing.</td>

    <td>A portal opens on the monolith, and the body of a huge winged animal falls to my feet. Its throat has been ritually cut, and its wings has been tattooed with faces of an ancient warrior tribe. The eyes though, the eyes look strange… Its original eyes have been cut out, and replaced by glittering red orbs. The more i look, the more they blaze. An advanced technology clearly lies at their center. Can i bear to desecrate this sacrifice for help with my journey?</td>
    <td>Remove sacrifice’s eyes – You’ll learn an Atlas word, get decrease in Vy’keen standing and Vy’keen Dagger. <br><br>Respect sacrifice – You’ll learn an Atlas word, get increased Vy’keen standing and health and shield at maximum.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The giant mouth of an ancient hound suddenly emerges through the face of the monolith. It opens its jaws wide, and foul-smelling spittle streaks my visor. My nausea is tempered by the sight of valuable commodities balanced on its giant tongue. In a sudden movement the hound shifts the goods to one side of its mouth, spraying saliva over my arms. There’s space on the tongue for more, should i wish to give up some of my cargo…</td>
    <td>Place goods on giant hound tongue (10 Carbon) – You’ll learn an Atlas word, get increased Vy’keen standing, Vy’keen Effigy, and health at maximum. <br><br>Remove goods from giant hound tongue – You’ll take damage, decrease with Vy’keen standing and Microdensity fabric item.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The monolith fragments before my eyes. It folds down in on itself, again and again, until it is a tiny red orb surrounded by dancing lights. It feels like something truly ancient, perhaps something divine, is showing me the origin of the strange constructions. The oxides i carry are physically dragging me towards it – desperate to help it rebuild. It’s not so much that I’m a pilgrim bearing offerings in hope of a blessing, but more that the elements i carry want to offer themselves…</td>
    <td>Give common oxide (100 iron) – You’ll get an increase in Vy’keen standing. <br><br>Give uncommon oxide (50 zinc) – You’ll get an increase in Vy’keen standing, learn an Atlas word, and Health at maximum. <br><br>Give rare oxide (50 Titanium) – You’ll get an increase in Vy’keen standing, learn an Atlas word, Health and Shield at maximum, and Vy’keen effigy.

    <td>The body of a gulled blob creature materializes on the surface of the rock. It is an ancient sacrifice, impaled through its wide, open eyes with metal spears. Liquid is dripping from the body down the monolith through a channel cut into the rock by ancient hands. It can be diverted toward two carvings – one of a sun, the other of a moon.</td>
    <td>Divert body liquid to sun – You’ll get an increase in Vy’keen standing, learn an Atlas word, Health at maximum, Blueprint. <br><br>Divert body liquid to moon – You’ll get an increase in Vy’keen standing, learn an Atlas word, Health at maximum, Blueprint (better version).

I can use my Protection Mesh functions, to dampen the imminent energy wave, but systems are too overwhelmed to identify it…</td>

    <td> I hear a low rumble, which gradually builds into an ancient scream. It’s like no noise I’ve ever experienced. To this strange alien landscape it’s a calm silence, inside my helmet it’s a nightmarish cacophony of pain and death. Through the noise, however, I can make out some words within the screams.</td>

The doppelganger first places its boltcaster to my forehead, and then mimes cutting my belly open with the mining beam. It smiles pleasantly. I am to choose my desired execution.</td>

The doppelganger makes a motion to suggest it wants something, and we both recoil when I realize I’ve instinctively matched its movements. Its body shimmers, but its equipment looks somehow real. Its multi-tool looks better than my own. The dimensional irregularity is fading.</td>
